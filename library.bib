abstract = {V921 Scorpii is a close binary system (separation 0farcs025) showing the B[e]-phenomenon. The system is surrounded by an enigmatic bipolar nebula, which might have been shaped by episodic mass-loss events, possibly triggered by dynamical interactions between the companion and the circumprimary disk. In this paper, we investigate the spatial structure and kinematics of the circumprimary disk, with the aim to obtain new insights into the still strongly debated evolutionary stage. For this purpose, we combine, for the first time, infrared spectro-interferometry (VLTI/AMBER, $\lambda$/$\Delta$$\lambda$ = 12, 000) and spectro-astrometry (VLT/CRIRES, $\lambda$/$\Delta$$\lambda$ = 100, 000), which allows us to study the AU-scale distribution of circumstellar gas and dust with an unprecedented velocity resolution of 3 km s-1. Using a model-independent photocenter analysis technique, we find that the Br$\gamma$-line-emitting gas rotates in the same plane as the dust disk. We can reproduce the wavelength-differential visibilities and phases and the double-peaked line profile using a Keplerian-rotating disk model. The derived mass of the central star is 5.4 {\textpm} 0.4 M ⊙ {\textperiodcentered} (d/1150 pc), which is considerably lower than expected from the spectral classification, suggesting that V921 Sco might be more distant (d {\textasciitilde} 2 kpc) than commonly assumed. Using the geometric information provided by our Br$\gamma$ spectro-interferometric data and Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund line decrement measurements in 61 hydrogen recombination line transitions, we derive the density of the line-emitting gas (Ne = (2-6) {\texttimes} 1019 m-3). Given that our measurements can be reproduced with a Keplerian velocity field without an outflowing velocity component and the non-detection of age-indicating spectroscopic diagnostics, our study provides new evidence for the pre-main-sequence nature of V921 Sco. Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under the open-time program ID 084.C-0668(A, B) and with the Magellan Clay telescope.},

abstract = {Using results and calibrations from a previous paper (Gullbring et al. 1997), we estimate disk accretion rates for pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus and Chamaeleon I molecular cloud complexes. The median accretion rate for T Tauri stars of age {\textasciitilde}1 Myr is {\textasciitilde}10-8 M⊙ yr-1 the intrinsic scatter at a given age may be as large as 1 order of magnitude. There is a clear decline of mass accretion rates {\.{M}} with increasing age t among T Tauri stars. Representing this decline as {\.{M}}{\textasciitilde}t-$\eta$, we estimate 1.5 <{\textasciitilde} $\eta$ <{\textasciitilde} 2.8; the large uncertainty is due to the wide range of accretion rates at a given age, the limited age range of the sample, and errors in estimating stellar ages and accretion luminosities. Adopting values of $\eta$ near the low end of this range, which are more likely given probable errors and the neglect of birthline age corrections, masses accreted during the T Tauri phase are roughly consistent with disk masses estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission. Similarity solutions for evolving, expanding disks are used to investigate observational constraints on disk properties employing a minimum of parameters. For an assumed power-law form of the disk viscosity with radius $\nu$ {\textasciitilde} R$\gamma$, $\eta$ >{\textasciitilde} 1.5 corresponds to $\gamma$ >{\textasciitilde} 1. The limit $\gamma$ {\textasciitilde} 1 corresponds to a roughly constant ``$\alpha$'' in the Shakura-Sunyaev (1973) viscosity parameterization; using current observed disk sizes, we estimate $\alpha$ {\textasciitilde} 10-2 (on scales {\textasciitilde}10-100 AU). Much of the observed variation in mass accretion rates can be accounted for by varying initial disk masses between 0.01 and 0.2 M⊙, but this result may be strongly affected by the presence of binary companion stars. These results emphasize the need for older samples of stars for studying disk evolution.},

abstract = {In a high-dispersion 1 $\mu$m survey of 39 classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) veiling is detected in 80% of the stars, and He I $\lambda$10830 and P$\gamma$ line emission in 97%. On average, the 1 $\mu$m veiling exceeds the level expected from previously identified sources of excess emission, suggesting the presence of an additional contributor to accretion luminosity in the star-disk interface region. Strengths of both lines correlate with veiling, and at P$\gamma$ there is a systematic progression in profile morphology with veiling. He I $\lambda$10830 has an unprecedented sensitivity to inner winds, showing blueshifted absorption below the continuum in 71% of the CTTSs, compared to 0% at P$\gamma$. This line is also sensitive to magnetospheric accretion flows, with redshifted absorption below the continuum found in 47% of the CTTSs, compared to 24% at P$\gamma$. The blueshifted absorption at He I $\lambda$10830 shows considerable diversity in its breadth and penetration depth into the continuum, indicating that a range of inner wind conditions exist in accreting stars. We interpret the broadest and deepest blue absorptions as formed from scattering of the 1 $\mu$m continuum by outflowing gas whose full acceleration region envelopes the star, suggesting radial outflow from the star. In contrast, narrow blue absorption with a range of radial velocities more likely arises via scattering of the 1 $\mu$m continuum by a wind emerging from the inner disk. Both stellar and disk winds are accretion powered, since neither is seen in nonaccreting WTTSs and among the CTTSs helium strength correlates with veiling.},

abstract = {Mass loss rates for the tenuous, hot winds of cool stars are extremely difficult to measure, yet they are a crucial ingredient in the stars' rotational evolution. We present a new method for measuring these mass loss rates in young, rapidly-rotating stars. These stars are known to support systems of "slingshot prominences" fed by hot wind material flowing up from the stellar surface into the summits of closed magnetic loop structures. The material gathers and cools near the co-rotation radius until its density becomes large enough that it is visible as a transient absorption feature in the hydrogen Balmer lines and strong resonance lines such as Ca II H \{\&}\ K. Here we present the key insight that the sonic point usually lies well below the condensation region. The flow at the wind base is therefore unaffected by the presence of an overlying prominence, so we can use the observed masses and recurrence times of the condensations to estimate the mass flux in the wind. These measurements extend the relationship between mass loss rate per unit surface area and X-ray flux to span 5 orders of magnitude. They demonstrate no evidence of the suspected weakening of stellar mass loss rates at high X-ray flux levels.},

abstract = {We present an extended grid of state-of-the art stellar models for low-mass stars including updated physics (nuclear reaction rates, surface boundary condition, mass-loss rate, angular momentum transport, torque and rotation-induced mixing prescriptions). We aim at evaluating the impact of wind braking, realistic atmospheric treatment, rotation and rotation-induced mixing on the structural and rotational evolution from the pre-main sequence to the turn-off. Using the STAREVOL code, we provide an updated PMS grid. We compute stellar models for 7 different metallicities, from [Fe/H] = -1 dex to [Fe/H] = +0.3 dex with a solar composition corresponding to $Z=0.0134$. The initial stellar mass ranges from 0.2 to 1.5\Ms with extra grid refinement around one solar mass. We also provide rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy in stably stratified regions. The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity -- and its constitutive physics -- is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions and initial solar composition. The models including rotation with our prescription for angular momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range. These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, TESS and PLATO.},

High-mass multiples might form via fragmentation of self-gravitational disks or alternative scenarios such as disk-assisted capture. However, only a few observational constraints exist on the architecture and disk structure of high-mass protobinaries and their accretion properties. Here, we report the discovery of a close (57.9 {\textpm} 0.2 mas = 170 au) high-mass protobinary, IRAS17216-3801, where our VLTI/GRAVITY+AMBER near-infrared interferometry allows us to image the circumstellar disks around the individual components with ∼3 mas resolution. We estimate the component masses to ∼20 and ∼18 Mo and find that the radial intensity profiles can be reproduced with an irradiated disk model, where the inner regions are excavated of dust, likely tracing the dust sublimation region in these disks. The circumstellar disks are strongly misaligned with respect to the binary separation vector, which indicates that the tidal forces did not have time to realign the disks, pointing toward a young dynamical age of the system. We constrain the distribution of the Br$\gamma$ and CO-emitting gas using VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-interferometry and VLT/CRIRES spectro-astrometry and find that the secondary is accreting at a higher rate than the primary. VLT/NACO imaging shows L{\textasciiacute}-band emission on (3-4){\texttimes} larger scales than the binary separation, matching the expected dynamical truncation radius for the circumbinary disk. The IRAS17216-3801 system is ∼3{\texttimes} more massive and ∼5{\texttimes} more compact than other high-mass multiplies imaged at infrared wavelength and the first high-mass protobinary system where circumstellar and circumbinary dust disks could be spatially resolved. This opens exciting new opportunities for studying star-disk interactions and the role of multiplicity in high-mass star formation.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution spectra of classical T Tauri stars in Taurus in the range 5800-9000 {\AA} to critically examine the current theories of magnetospheric accretion. In this paper, we focus on the emission lines of hydrogen (the higher Paschen series and H$\alpha$), He i lambda5876, O i lambda7773 and lambda8446, the Na D lines, and the Ca ii infrared triplet. We argue that the magnetospheric infall zone is the likely source of emission for the hydrogen, oxygen, and sodium lines for most of the stars in our sample. As has been previously shown, the calcium and helium lines have a narrow and a broad component; focusing on the broad components, we find that they are likely formed in the magnetosphere for at least several of the stars in the sample. Preliminary calculations indicate that the magnetospheric models developed to explain the Balmer lines predict significant Ca ii, Paschen, and O i emission, roughly comparable to what is observed. However, in some of the stars, especially at high veilings, the case for line formation in the accretion flow is not clear. Finally, our results suggest that the Ca ii IR triplet lines are good indicators of the accretion rate for all but the most weakly accreting T Tauri stars.},

abstract = {It has recently been suggested that the winds from classical T Tauri stars in general, and the wind from TW Hya in particular, reaches temperatures of 300,000 K while maintaining a mass-loss rate of {\textasciitilde}10-11 Msolar yr-1 or larger. If confirmed, this would place strong new requirements on wind launching and heating models. We therefore reexamine spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer satellite in an effort to better constrain the maximum temperature in the wind of TW Hya. We find clear evidence for a wind in the C II doublet at 1037 {\AA} and in the C II multiplet at 1335 {\AA}. We find no wind absorption in the C IV $\lambda$1550 doublet observed at the same time as the C II $\lambda$1335 line or in observations of O VI observed simultaneously with the C II $\lambda$1037 line. The presence or absence of C III wind absorption is ambiguous. The clear lack of a wind in the C IV line argues that the wind from TW Hya does not reach the 100,000 K characteristic formation temperature of this line. We therefore argue that the available evidence suggests that the wind from TW Hya, and perhaps all classical T Tauri stars, reaches a maximum temperature in the range of 10,000-30,000 K. This work is based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with program GTO-7718.

Here we report the detection of six repeat bursts from FRB~180814.J0422+73, one of the 13 FRBs detected6 by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) FRB project7 during its pre-commissioning phase in July and August 2018. These repeat bursts are consistent with originating from a single position on the sky, with the same dispersion measure, about 189 pc cm{\textminus}3. This traces approximately twice the expected Milky Way column density, and implies an upper limit on the source redshift of 0.1, at least a factor of about 2 closer than FRB~1211028. In some of the repeat bursts, we observe sub-pulse frequency structure, drifting, and spectral variation reminiscent of that seen in FRB~1211029,10, suggesting similar emission mechanisms and/or propagation effects. This second repeater, found among the first few CHIME/FRB discoveries, suggests that there exists{\textemdash}and that CHIME/FRB and other wide-field, sensitive radio telescopes will find{\textemdash}a substantial population of repeating FRBs.},

In Classical T Tauri stars, there is evidence for the existence of a wide angle wind at scales {\&}lt; 100 AU, which supports the X-wind model prediction that narrow jets are the result of density/temperature enhancement towards the axis of the system. However, recent HST observations of the DG Tau jet indicate that the opening angle of the wind is more confined than predicted by the X-wind model, in better agreement with disk wind theories.</p> </div>},

abstract = {Pre-main-sequence stars are observed to be surrounded by both accretion flows and some kind of wind or jetlike outflow. Recent work by Matt and Pudritz has suggested that if classical T Tauri stars exhibit stellar winds with mass-loss rates about 0.1 times their accretion rates, the wind can carry away enough angular momentum to keep the stars from being spun up unrealistically by accretion. This paper presents a preliminary set of theoretical models of accretion-driven winds from the polar regions of T Tauri stars. These models are based on recently published self-consistent simulations of the Sun's coronal heating and wind acceleration. In addition to the convection-driven MHD turbulence (which dominates in the solar case), we add another source of wave energy at the photosphere that is driven by the impact of plasma in neighboring flux tubes undergoing magnetospheric accretion. This added energy, determined quantitatively from the far-field theory of MHD wave generation, is sufficient to produce T Tauri-like mass-loss rates of at least 0.01 times the accretion rate. While still about an order of magnitude below the level required for efficient angular momentum removal, these are the first self-consistent models of T Tauri winds that agree reasonably well with a range of observational mass-loss constraints. The youngest modeled stellar winds are supported by Alfv{\'e}n wave pressure, they have low temperatures ("extended chromospheres"), and they are likely to be unstable to the formation of counterpropagating shocks and clumps far from the star.},

The wind is assumed to originate in the inner regions of an accretion disk surrounding the T Tauri star, and flows outward in a 'cone' geometry. Two types of wind models are considered, both with monotonically increasing expansion velocities as a function of radial distance. For flows with large turbulent velocities, such as the HF Alfven wave-driven wind models, the effect of cone geometry is to increase the blue wing emission, and to move the absorption reversal close to line center. Line profiles for a wind model rotating with the same angular velocity as the inner disk are also calculated. The Balmer lines of this model are significantly broader than observed in most objects, suggesting that the observed emission lines do not arise in a region rotating at Keplerian velocity.},

Altogether, we tabulated about 3600 transitions and listed scaling relations for the hydrogenlike ions He II and Li III . The selected data are based on a critical evaluation of available literature sources and are all taken from recent advanced calculations. The tables are normally arranged in multiplets, and these are ordered in increasing excitation energies. For hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium, the energy levels are degenerate, i.e., all energy levels of the same principal quantum number essentially coincide. Thus, the principal tables for these species are for the average transition probabilities of lines between different principal quantum numbers.},

abstract = {We perform local excitation calculations to obtain line opacities and emissivity ratios, and compare them with observed properties of H, He I, O I, Ca II and Na I lines to determine the requisite conditions of density, temperature and photon ionization rate. We find that ultraviolet photoionization is the most probable excitation mechanism for generating the He I$\lambda$10830 opacities that produce all the associated absorption features. We also calculate the specific line flux at an observed velocity of vobs={\textpm}150 km s-1 for both radial wind and infall models. All the model results, together with observed correlations between absorption and emission features and between narrow and broad emission components, are used to deduce the origins of the strong H, He I and Ca II broad line emission. We conclude that the first two arise primarily in a radial outflow that is highly clumpy. The bulk of the wind volume is filled by gas at a density {\~{ }}109 cm-3 and optically thick to He I$\lambda$10830 and H$\alpha$, but optically thin to He I$\lambda$5876, Pa$\gamma$ and the Ca II infrared triplet. The optically thick He I$\lambda$5876 emission occurs mostly in regions of density $\ge$1011 cm-3 and temperature $\ge$1.5 {\texttimes} 104 K, while the optically thick H$\alpha$ and Pa$\gamma$ emission occurs mostly in regions of density around 1011 cm-3 and temperature between 8750 and 1.25 {\texttimes} 104 K. In producing the observed line fluxes at a given vobs, the covering factor of these emission clumps is sufficiently small to not incur significant absorption of the stellar and veiling continua in either He I or H lines. The strong Ca II broad line emission likely arises in both the magnetospheric accretion flow and the disc boundary layer where the gases dissipate part of their rotational energies before infalling along magnetic field lines. The needed density and temperature are {\~{ }}1012 cm-3 and $\le$7500 K, respectively.},

abstract = {We present results from a low-resolution (Rsimeq 300) near-infrared spectroscopic variability survey of actively accreting T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. Paschen and Brackett series H I recombination lines were detected in 73 spectra of 15 classical T Tauri systems. The values of the Panup/Pa$\beta$, Brnup/Br$\gamma$, and Br$\gamma$/Panup H I line ratios for all observations exhibit a scatter of lesssim20% about the weighted mean, not only from source to source, but also for epoch-to-epoch variations in the same source. A representative or "global" value was determined for each ratio in both the Paschen and Brackett series, as well as the Br$\gamma$/Panup line ratios. A comparison of observed line ratio values was made to those predicted by the temperature- and electron density-dependent models of case B hydrogen recombination line theory. The measured line ratios are statistically well fit by a tightly constrained range of temperatures (Tlesssim 2000 K) and electron densities (109 cm -3 < nelesssim 1010 cm-3). A comparison of the observed line ratio values to the values predicted by the optically thick and thin local thermodynamic equilibrium cases rules out these conditions for the emitting H I gas. Therefore, the emission is consistent with having an origin in a non-LTE recombining gas. While the range of electron densities is consistent with the gas densities predicted by existing magnetospheric accretion models, the temperature range constrained by the case B comparison is considerably lower than that expected for accreting gas. The cooler gas temperatures will require a nonthermal excitation process (e.g., coronal/accretion-related X-rays and UV photons) to power the observed line emission.},

TORUS uses a 1-D, 2-D or 3-D adaptive mesh refinement scheme to store and manipulate the state variables, and solves the equation of radiative transfer using Monte Carlo techniques. A framework of microphysics modules is described, including atomic and molecular line transport in moving media, dust radiative equilibrium, photoionisation equilibrium, and time-dependent radiative transfer. These modules provide a flexible scheme for producing synthetic observations, either from analytical models or as post-processing of hydrodynamical simulations (both grid-based and Lagrangian). A hydrodynamics module is also presented, which may be used in combination with the radiation-transport modules to perform radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Benchmarking and validation tests of each major mode of operation are detailed, along with descriptions and performance/scaling tests of the various parallelisation schemes. We give examples on the uses of the code in the literature, including applications to low- and high-mass star formation, cluster feedback, and stellar winds, along with an Appendix listing the refereed papers that have used TORUS.},

abstract = {In a multi-site photometric campaign to monitor T Tauri stars (TTS) in the Taurus-Auriga cloud over more than two months - dubbed Coordinated Observations of Young ObjecTs from Earthbound Sites (COYOTES), we find all 24 of our target stars show evidence for periodic light variations with periods between 1.2 and 24.0 days. This more than doubles the number of periods published for Tan-Aur TTS. The variations of 20 of these stars can be interpreted as rotational modulation of the stellar flux by surface spots. The periods of the four remaining stars (RY Tan, BD+24{\textdegree}676, TAP 26, and LkCa-21) may correspond to orbital periods of binary systems. Models of the UBVRI light curves lead to the properties of the spots, both hotter and cooler than the photo spheric temperature, which appear to be the principal source of the photometric variability of TTS on timescales of days and weeks. The longest rotational period we measure (12 d, for GM Aur) leads to an equatorial velocity of 8km s-1, which confirms the paucity of extremely slow rotators (Veq $\le$ $\le$ 10km s-1) among TTS younger than 5 106 yrs. Combining our 20 rotational periods with those published for 17 other Tan-Aur TTS, we find that the Weak-line TTS (EW(H$\alpha$) < 10{\AA}) rotate faster than Classical TTS (EW(H$\alpha$) $\ge$ 10{\AA}) at the 99.9% confidence level (according to a K-S test). The mean rotational period for the 11 WTTS is 4.1{\textpm}1.7d; for the l5 CTTS, 7.6{\textpm}2.1d. We interpret this difference as evidence that WTTS spin-up as they contract on their convective tracks, while CTTS are prevented from doing so by either (a) their strong winds carrying away excess angular momentum and/or (b) a magnetic coupling between the stars and their inner accretion disks, as suggested by recent models. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for the subsequent evolution of TTS toward the main sequence. In particular, we propose that the different rotational histories of WTTS and CTTS on their convective tracks may account for the large range of rotational velocities observed among low-mass dwarfs in young clusters.},

abstract = {We present a numerical method and computer code to calculate the radiative transfer and excitation of molecular lines. Formulating the Monte Carlo method from the view-point of cells rather than photons allows us to separate local and external contributions to the radiation field. This separation is critical to accurate and fast performance at high optical depths ($\tau$ ≳ 100). The random nature of the Monte Carlo method serves to verify the independence of the solution to the angular, spatial, and frequency sampling of the radiation field. These features allow use of our method in a wide variety of astrophysical problems without specific adaptations: in any axially symmetric source model and for all atoms or molecules for which collisional rate coefficients are available. Continuum emission and absorption by dust is explicitly taken into account but scattering is neglected. We illustrate these features in calculations of (i) the HCO+ J=1-0 and 3-2 emission from a flattened protostellar envelope with infall and rotation, (ii) the CO, HCO+, CN and HCN emission from a protoplanetary disk and (iii) HCN emission from a high-mass young stellar object, where infrared pumping is important. The program can be used for optical depths up to 103-104, depending on source model. We expect this program to be an important tool in analysing data from present and future infrared and (sub) millimetre telescopes.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the longitudinal magnetic field in the circumstellar environment of seven classical T Tauri stars. The measurements are based on high-resolution circular spectropolarimetry of the HeI$\lambda$5876 emission line, which is thought to form in accretion streams controlled by a stellar magnetosphere. We detect magnetic fields in BP Tau, DF Tau and DN Tau, and detect statistically significant fields in GM Aur and RW Aur A at one epoch but not at others. We detect no field for DG Tau and GG Tau, with the caveat that these objects were observed at one epoch only. Our measurements for BP Tau and DF Tau are consistent, in terms of both sign and magnitude, with previous studies, suggesting that the characteristics of T Tauri magnetospheres are persistent over several years. We observed the magnetic field of BP Tau to decline monotonically over three nights, and have detected a peak field of 4 kG in this object, the highest magnetic field yet observed in a T Tauri star. We combine our observations with results from the literature in order to perform a statistical analysis of the magnetospheric fields in BP Tau and DF Tau. Assuming a dipolar field, we determine a polar field of {\textasciitilde}3 kG and a dipole offset of 40{\textdegree} for BP Tau, while the field of DF Tau is consistent with a polar field of {\textasciitilde}-4.5 kG and a dipole offset of 10{\textdegree}. We conclude that many classical T Tauri stars have circumstellar magnetic fields that are both strong enough and sufficiently globally ordered to sustain large-scale magnetospheric accretion flows.},

The line shows strong variability ({\textasciitilde}10 per cent) over the velocity range 100-420 km s-1 in the red broad absorption component, and weaker variability ({\textasciitilde}2 per cent) over the velocity range -200-0kms-1 in the blue wing. The variability in the velocity range -200-0kms-1 is correlated with that in 200-400kms-1, and the variability in these velocity ranges anticorrelates with that in 0-100kms-1. The mean spectrum from the second night shows the suggestion of a blueshifted absorption component at about -150kms-1, similar to that found in the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. We find the position of the subpeak in the red absorption component changes steadily with time, and its motion modulates at half the rotational period. We also find that the modulation of the line equivalent width is possibly associated with a half and a third of the rotational period, which is consistent with the surface Doppler images of SU Aur. Radiative transfer models of a rotationally modulated Pa$\beta$ line, produced in the shock-heated magnetospheric accretion flow, are also presented. Models with a magnetic dipole offset reproduce the overall characteristics of the observed line variability, including the line equivalent width and the motion of the subpeak in the red absorption trough.},

In four of the stars, the profiles have the signature of resonance scattering, and they possess a deep and broad blueshifted absorption that penetrates more than 50% into the 1 $\mu$m continuum over a continuous range of velocities from near the stellar rest velocity to the terminal velocity of the wind, unlike inner wind signatures seen in other spectral features. This deep and broad absorption provides the first observational tracer of the acceleration region of the inner wind and suggests that this acceleration region is situated such that it occults a significant portion of the stellar disk. The remaining two stars also have blue absorption extending below the continuum, although here the profiles are dominated by emission, requiring an additional source of helium excitation beyond resonant scattering. This is likely the same process that produces the emission profiles seen at He I 5876 {\AA}.},

abstract = {We compare the angular momentum extracted by a wind from a pre-main-sequence star to the torques arising from the interaction between the star and its Keplerian accretion disk. We find that the wind alone can counteract the spin-up torque from mass accretion, solving the mystery of why accreting pre-main-sequence stars are observed to spin at less than 10% of breakup speed, provided that the mass outflow rate in the stellar winds is ∼10% of the accretion rate. We suggest that such massive winds will be driven by some fraction $\varepsilon$ of the accretion power. For observationally constrained typical parameters of classical T Tauri stars, $\varepsilon$ needs to be between a few and a few tens of percent. In this scenario, efficient braking of the star will terminate simultaneously with accretion, as is usually assumed to explain the rotation velocities of stars in young clusters. {\textcopyright} 2005.

abstract = {In accreting young stars one of the prominent spectral features in the near infrared is the Paschen and Brackett series in emission. We examine hydrogen line ratios for 16 classical T Tauri stars from SpeX spectra and find differences between stars with low and high mass accretion rates. The observed line ratios are compared to two theoretical models for line formation: (1) Baker and Menzel's Case B for radiative ionization and recombination and (2) a set of local line excitation calculations by Kwan and Fischer designed to replicate the conditions in T Tauri winds and magnetic accretion columns. The predictions of the local line excitation models give consistent results across multiple diagnostics, in contrast to Case B. Under the assumptions of the local line excitation, we find that the number density in the hydrogen line formation region is constrained to 2x10^{10} - 2x10^{11} per cubic centimeter, where stars with higher accretion rates have densities at the higher end of this range. Because of uncertainties in extinction, temperature is not well constrained, but falls within the range expected for collisional excitation to produce the line photons. The local line excitation ratios offer a new approach to determining extinction to embedded sources as well as densities in the region where hydrogen lines are formed.},

Having calculated self-consistent line profiles of the Balmer lines, Pa$\beta$ and Br$\gamma$, we explore parameter space, examining the effects of the magnetospheric gas temperature and size on the line fluxes. We compare model and observed line fluxes for the Balmer lines and find a good match using a relatively small range of parameters. We are also able to match the observed Br$\gamma$ line profile of the embedded object WL 16, which supports the use of the infrared lines in studying magnetospheric infall even in the earliest stages of star formation.

abstract = {Aims. We investigate the accretion process from an accretion disk onto a magnetized rotating star with a purely dipolar magnetic field. Our main aim is to study the mechanisms that regulate the stellar angular momentum. In this work, we consider two effects that can contrast with the spin-up torque normally associated with accretion: (1) the spin-down torque exerted by an extended magnetosphere connected to the disk beyond the corotation radius; (2) the spin-down torque determined by a stellar wind flowing along the opened magnetospheric field lines. Methods: Our study is based on time-dependent axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of the interaction between a viscous and resistive accretion disk with the dipolar magnetosphere of a rotating star. We present the first example of a numerical experiment able to model at the same time the formation of accretion curtains, the effects of an extended stellar magnetosphere and the launching of a stellar wind. Results: In the examples presented, the spin-down torque related to the star-disk interaction can extract only {\~{ }}10% of the accretion torque, due to the weakness of the extended connection. Not even the spin-down torque exerted by a stellar wind is strong enough ({\~{ }}20%): despite a huge lever arm (RA $\approx$ 19 R_star), the mass-loss rate (dot{M}_wind $\approx$ 1% dot{M}_acc) is too low to provide an efficient torque. Conclusions: We argue that, at least in the case of typical classical T Tauri stars (dot{M}_acc $\approx$ 10-8 M_⊙ yr-1, Bstar, dipole ⪉ 1 kG) rotating at 10% of their break-up speed, the disk spin-down is unlikely to balance the accretion torque ({\textquotedblleft}disk locked{\textquotedblright} equilibrium). A massive stellar wind (dot{M}_wind $\approx$ 20% dot{M}_acc) could in principle succeed, but its mass and energy fluxes are quite demanding, both from a theoretical and an observational point of view.},

The absorption depths of cooler, low-ionization lines peak at low velocities {\textendash} while more highly ionized lines have peak absorption depths at high velocities. The different line profiles indicate that the temperature and density of the accretion stream increase as material approaches the star.

abstract = {Disc accretion to a rotating star with a non-dipole magnetic field is investigated for the first time in full three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We investigated the cases of (1) pure dipole, (2) pure quadrupole, and (3) dipole plus quadrupole fields. The quadrupole magnetic moment D is taken to be parallel to the dipole magnetic moment $\mu$, and both are inclined relative to the spin axis of the star $\Omega$. at an angle $\Theta$. Simulations have shown that in each case the structure of the funnel streams and associated hotspots on the surface of the star have specific features connected with the magnetic field configuration. In the pure dipole case, matter accretes in two funnel streams which form two arch-like spots near the magnetic poles. In the case of a pure quadrupole field, most of the matter flows through the quadrupole `belt' forming a ring-shaped hot region on the magnetic equator. In the case of a dipole plus quadrupole field, magnetic flux in the Northern magnetic hemisphere is larger than that in the Southern magnetic hemisphere, and the quadrupole belt and the ring are displaced to the south. The stronger the quadrupole, the closer the ring is to the magnetic equator. At sufficiently large $\Theta$, matter also flows to the south pole, forming a hotspot near the pole. The light curves have a variety of different features which makes it difficult to derive the magnetic field configuration from the light curves. There are specific features which are different in cases of dipole- and quadrupole-dominated magnetic field: (1) angular momentum flow between the star and disc is more efficient in the case of the dipole field; and (2) hotspots are hotter and brighter in the case of the dipole field because the matter accelerates over a longer distance compared with the flow in a quadrupole case.},

abstract = {We present the emission-line profile models of hydrogen and helium based on the results from axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the wind formed near the disc-magnetosphere boundary of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). We extend the previous outflow models of 'the conical-shell wind' by Romanova et al. to include a well-defined magnetospheric accretion funnel flow which is essential for modelling the optical and near-infrared hydrogen and helium lines of CTTSs. The MHD model with an intermediate mass-accretion rate shows outflows in conical-shell shape with a half opening angle {\~{ }}35{\textdegree}. The flow properties such as the maximum outflow speed in the conical-shell wind, maximum inflow speed in the accretion funnel, mass accretion and mass-loss rates are comparable to those found in a typical CTTS. The density, velocity and modified temperature from the MHD simulations are used in a separate radiative transfer model to predict the line profiles and test the consistency of the MHD models with observations. The line profiles are computed with various combinations of X-ray luminosities, temperatures of X-ray-emitting plasma and inclination angles. A rich diversity of line profile morphology is found, and many of the model profiles are very similar to those found in observations. We find that the conical-shell wind may contribute to the emission in some hydrogen lines (e.g. H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, Pa$\beta$ and Pa$\gamma$) significantly when the temperature in the wind is relatively high (e.g. {\~{ }}104 K); however, the wind contribution decreases rapidly when a lower wind temperature is adopted. The model well reproduces a relatively narrow and low-velocity blueshifted absorption component in He I $\lambda$10830, which are often seen in observations.},

abstract = {The dynamical and radiative consequences of disk accretion onto magnetic T Tauri stars (TTS) are examined using the Ghosh and Lamb model. It is shown that a prolonged disk accretion phase is compatible with the low rotation rates measured in these stars if they possess a kilogauss strength field that disrupts the disk at a distance of a few stellar radii from the center. It is estimated that a steady state in which the net torque exerted on the star is zero can be attained on a time scale that is shorter than the age of the youngest visible TTS. Although the disk does not develop an ordinary shear boundary layer in this case, one can account for the observed UV excess and Balmer emission in terms of the shocks that form at the bottom of the high-latitude magnetic accretion columns on the stellar surface. This picture also provides a natural explanation of some of the puzzling variability properties of stars like DF Tau and RY Lup. YY Ori stars are interpreted as magnetic TTS in which the observer's line of sight is roughly parallel to an accretion column.},

abstract = {Accretion through circumstellar disks plays an important role in star formation and in establishing the properties of the regions in which planets form and migrate. The mechanisms by which protostellar and protoplanetary disks accrete onto low-mass stars are not clear; angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is thought to be involved, but the low-ionization conditions in major regions of protoplanetary disks lead to a variety of complex nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects whose implications are not fully understood. Accretion in pre-main-sequence stars of masses ≲1M⊙ (and in at least some 2{\textendash}3-M⊙ systems) is generally funneled by the stellar magnetic field, which disrupts the disk at scales typically of order a few stellar radii. Matter moving at near free-fall velocities shocks at the stellar surface; the resulting accretion luminosities from the dissipation of kinetic energy indicate that mass addition during the T Tauri phase over the typical disk lifetime ∼3 Myr is modest in terms of stellar evo...},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate how mass outflows from young stars relate to circumstellar disks by analyzing spectroscopic data of 42 T Tauri stars that span a broad range of infrared excesses. We measure the optical excess continuum (veiling) in each star from high-resolution 4 m spectra and extract forbidden line profiles uncontaminated by terrestrial night-sky emission, photospheric absorption lines, and telluric absorption lines. The veiling fluxes combined with existing infrared photometry allow us to estimate reddenings and stellar luminosities for the first time for heavily veiled stars. The new estimates of the stellar luminosities of these objects indicate that the stars with the highest accretion rates are the youngest in the sample. There is a one-to-one correspondence between forbidden line emission, veiling, and near-infrared color excess among the stars in our sample; all disks around young stars which are both optically thick and extend inward to within a few stellar radii of the stellar surface are, in fact, accretion disks, and have forbidden line emission. Residual forbidden line profiles of [O I] $\lambda$6300, [O I] $\lambda$5577, - [S II] $\lambda$6731, and [N II] $\lambda$6583 represent a range of critical densities from 104 to 108 cm-3. We have determined luminosities and line ratios for the two distinct velocity components in each of these forbidden lines. The high-velocity component resembles a dense stellar jet but requires more than a single shock to account for the observed line ratios. Luminosities of the high-velocity component indicate mass-loss rates of 10-8 to 10-10 Msun yr-1 for most stars and disk accretion rates derived from the veiling fluxes are 10-6 to 10-8 Msun yr-1. The mass outflow rates and mass accretion rates are correlated. The ratio of mass outflow rate to the mass accretion rate depends upon how the forbidden line luminosities are interpreted but is probably {\~{ }}0.01 for most classical T Tauri stars. The low-velocity component originates in a region of higher density than the high-velocity component and is characterized by a small negative radial velocity ({\~{ }}-5 km s-1), possibly associated with a disk wind or magnetic accretion columns. The velocity shifts are largest for forbidden lines with the lowest critical density, suggesting that the low-velocity component accelerates away from the surface of the disk. If the low-velocity component arises on the surface of a disk in Keplerian rotation, then the observed profiles imply a disk surface brightness which decreases as {\~{ }}r-2.2.},

The models are computed under the Sobolev approximation using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative-transfer code TORUS. We have calculated four illustrative models in which the accretion flows are confined to azimuthal curtains - a geometry predicted by magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Properties of the line profile variability of our models are discussed, with reference to dynamic spectra and cross-correlation images. We find that some gross characteristics of the observed line profile variability are reproduced by our models, although in general the level of variability predicted is larger than that observed. We conclude that this excessive variability probably excludes dynamical simulations that predict accretion flows with low degrees of axisymmetry.},

abstract = {Cosmic dust is present in many astrophysical objects, and recent observations across the electromagnetic spectrum show that the dust distribution is often strongly three-dimensional (3D). Dust grains are effective in absorbing and scattering ultraviolet (UV)/optical radiation, and they re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these objects, including the dust itself, therefore requires 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes. We end with an outlook on the bright future of this field.},
